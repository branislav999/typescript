# Overview


As a software engineer I am trying to further my learning by practicing skills I have been introduced to in the past, and want to build my confidence in front-end developing. This project focuses on creating a dynamic website that interacts with an API to fetch and siplay games based on a genre that a user has selected. 
The purpose is to deepen my understadning of TypeScript's syntax, particularly its strong typing system and support for modern JavaScript features.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Perhaps add more functionality to the user, have the user be able to find the games based on other criteria, not only genres
- Apply CSS to provide a better user experience
- Make functions in the code more reusable
